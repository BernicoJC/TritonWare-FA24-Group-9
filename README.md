# Terminal
The repo for TritonWare Fall 2024 Group 9's submission.

Terminal is a 2D top down minigame that has the player collect several items in order to open the gate of the level and escape to win the game. The level is dark and filled with monsters that spawn every few seconds. The only thing that the player has to defend themselves is their reaction time. There are four monster types and any wrong move to react to them is going to cause a game over: sometimes panic, sometimes donâ€™t! The game has a decaying lighting system that can be refueled using items picked up throughout the level.
